            I earned my GED and decided to pursue an associate's degree in software development at Central Arizona College. I graduated in May and decided to keep pursuing my education. I was born and raised in Coolidge, Arizona. I enjoy coding and learning about the latest trends and technologies. In my spare time, I like going to the movies, cooking out, and spending time with my family. I play video games every now and then and mostly focus on creating websites and graphics for my portfolio. I am a very ambitious person and always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. My passion for technology drives me to stay updated with the latest advancements, and I am constantly seeking new challenges to enhance my expertise. Whether it's through online courses, attending workshops, or collaborating with peers, I am committed to expanding my knowledge base. My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry and contribute to innovative projects that solve real-world problems. I believe in lifelong learning and strive to continuously grow both personally and professionally. My dedication to my craft and my enthusiasm for helping others are what motivate me to excel in my field.
